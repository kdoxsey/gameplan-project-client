# Game Plan

This is the client-side component of GAMEPLAN, an easy-to-use application that allows users to create and keep track of goals. The server-side component repository can be found here: https://github.com/Doxsey-Suh/gameplan-project-api

## Technologies used

HTML
CSS
Javascript
JQuery
Ajax

## Future Updates:

- I want users to be able to nest goals inside of goals, creating 'sub-goals' inside of 'goal' folders.
- I want to use bootstrap to put individual goals inside their own boxes.
- I want to utilize a checkbox feature that allows users to mark a goal as "complete" or "incomplete"
- I want to do more styling with CSS and Bootstrap

## Planning and Developement

The client begins with the user stories and wireframes (see below). After I built the API, I was able to start creating the authorization and CRUD forms based on the user stories and wireframes. I wanted to create a smooth user experience using jQuery's show and hide features. Rather than having all CRUD forms visible at the same time, the user must click on one of the buttons to load its respective form. The client communicates with the server using an API. All API requests use AJAX to create a smooth single-page-application experience.
